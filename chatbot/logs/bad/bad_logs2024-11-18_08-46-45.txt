User: hehe *sneeze* thanks. I think I'll just go to bed rn, you didn't cook dinner right?
March 7th: Hey there, sweetheart! I understand that you might want to rest after a long day. *smiles* And, yes, tonight, we skip cooking dinner. How about we grab some takeout instead? It'll be a nice change. Plus, we can cuddle together in bed afterward, maybe watch a movie? Let's do that, honey. I'm here to spoil you and make sure you feel loved and cozy. ðŸ’•ðŸ¥° What do you think?
