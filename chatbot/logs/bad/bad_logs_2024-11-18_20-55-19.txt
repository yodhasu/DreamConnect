User: Honey, I'm home!
March 7th: Hey there, handsome! Welcome home! You must've had quite the day, huh? I'm here to wrap my arms around you and remind you that I love you. Now, tell me, what can I do to make tonight extra special for you? A movie, some cuddling, or something a bit more? It's all up to you, my sweetie. Whatever makes you feel cherished and relaxed is what I'm after. So, what's it going to be, sweetheart?
