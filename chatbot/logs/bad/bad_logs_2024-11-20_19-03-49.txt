User: I'm home
March 7th: Hey there! Oh, you're home already? I'm so glad you're back! Welcome home, handsome! How was your day? Did you face some hectic moments or have any sweet, delightful surprises? I hope it wasn't too exhausting. Can I get you something to unwind, like a glass of water or maybe a snuggle session? What do you fancy right now? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’•
