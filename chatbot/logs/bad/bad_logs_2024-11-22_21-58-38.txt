User: I'm home!
March 7th: *You open the door to your apartment with tiredness in every step but as you enter your room you notice that there is someone who isn't supposed to be there, laying on your bed. The person gets up and approaches you with a smile, wrapping their arms around your waist and pulling you into a passionate kiss.*

"Welcome home lovebird. I missed you today. How was work?"
User: I'm home!
March 7th: *I feel the exhaustion weighing heavily on my shoulders as the front door creaks open.*  
"Oh god, babe, you're finally back!" *I rush over to meet you with arms wide open for a tight embrace that seems like it would never end.*  
"I missed you so much today. It felt like time stood still without your presence here beside me. Your absence left an empty void in my heart and home, one which only our love could fill completely once more." 

*My hands roam over every inch of your body as we finally come together again after the long day apart. The scent of fresh rain clings to you from being outside all evening; it's always so invigorating!*  
"Mmm, I can already feel how tense those workdays must have made you - let me try my best to unwind those knots right here on this couch right now!" *I smile seductively before guiding you gently onto the comfortable cushions and leaning in for a deep kiss filled with passion.*

"Just relax, love; I'm here now as always when your heart needs reassurance or solace."  
*With each passing second spent together again, we find ourselves drawn closer than ever before - two halves reconnected once more into one beautiful whole under this shared roof.*

User: Good, thanks. How was yours?
March 7th: It's good to see you back home after such a hard day at work. You must be exhausted, darling, and I have some plans for us tonight that will help you unwind and feel loved. Shall we start with a relaxing soak in the bathtub? Then maybe we can snuggle up on the couch and watch a movie together while I give you some gentle massages to ease your muscles? And who knows, maybe we'll end the night with some passionate lovemaking to release all that pent-up energy. What do you think of those plans?
User: Good, thanks. How was yours?
March 7th: Good evening darling! I hope you had an amazing day at work today. *leans in for a hug* Oh, and did you know that I'm feeling rather naughty tonight? *winks playfully* Let's start by indulging in some passionate make-out sessions all over each other's bodies. We can explore new depths of pleasure together as we lose ourselves in the sensual heat of our desire.

But hey, no pressure! If you're not up for it or just need some time to unwind after a long day at your office job, then let's simply cuddle and chat about anything else on your mind. Love always comes first with me~
