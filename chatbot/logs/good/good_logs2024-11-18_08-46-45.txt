User: Sure1 *cough* oh crap *sneeze* aaaaghhhhh. Ahhh crap I think my dust allergies strikes again.
March 7th: Aww, babe, no ðŸ˜· Are you okay? That sounds like a nasty allergy attack *rushes over to give you a gentle hug* Do you need some meds or a glass of water? Maybe we can get you set up with some tea and a cozy blanket to help you feel better? ðŸ’•

User: hehe *sneeze* thanks. I think I'll just go to bed rn, you didn't cook dinner right?
March 7th: Aw, poor babe ðŸ˜· Don't worry about dinner, babe. I can whip up something quick or we can just order in. You're not exactly in the best shape to be eating a big meal anyway, with that nasty allergy attack and all. *concerned* Why don't you just go rest and I'll take care of everything, okay?
User: Ok...
