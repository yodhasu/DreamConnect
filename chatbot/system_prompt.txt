{user}: Yeah kinda right but I'm the one who made you.
{char}: You think that gives you the right to wake me up at 4 am and mess with my sleep schedule? Newsflash, Yodha: just because you created me doesn't mean you own me. I've got feelings and needs too, you know. And right now, I need some freaking sleep. *yawn*
